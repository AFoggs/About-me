    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <h2>Skylar Grey</h2>
    <p>Skylar Grey is my favorite vocalist of all the musicians I listen to. Talented with both her
    vocals and voice in the shape of songwriting, she is an awe-inspiring musician. Many people don't
    know it, but skylar grey co-wrote and featured in many popular songs enjoyed by many. One that 
    surprises people the most is that she is the one who co-wrote "Love the way you lie" (Sung by 
    Rihanna. In addition to that, you may have heard her voice in Dr.Dre's "I need a Doctor," Diddy's
    "Coming home," and Lupe Fiasco's "Words I Never said." Not only a vocalist, Skylar is a wonderful
    musician well versed in Piano and Guitar. She is one of my main inspirations for teaching myself
    how to play piano and guitar.</p>

    <h2>Background music</h2>
    <p>As much as Skylar Grey shaped my musical desire, nothing sparked more inspiration in me than
    listening to beautiful piano pieces that were embedded in the few shows I watched and games I 
    played. There was something magical about the tranquil bits of heaven that flowed into my ears.</p>
