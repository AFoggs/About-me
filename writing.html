    <h2>Why I write</h2>
      <p>Art, words, images, the world around me, the sound of sweet voices and symphonies; in it lies<br>
       my addiction to consume such wonders, but also to join the world as a creator. I guess that's<br>
       why I started writing. I wanted to be consumed.

    <h2>Poetry</h2>
    <h3>late night panic</h3>
      <p>
        and in his indulgence of thought,</br>
        his sanity was foregone;</br>
        left alongside the sun as it slipped beyond the horizon.</br>
        gently. for the madness seeps in like a slow poison./<br>
        the anguish only when it's far too late.</br>
        and he screams.</br>
        and he screams.</br>
        and he gasps hopelessly for useless oxygen,</br>
        grasping desperately for sunlight only a few hours away.

    <h3>soft scent</h3>
      <p>
        Sweet memories carried</br>
        on the wind</br>
        quiet but swift;</br>
        swift but loud</br>
        </br>
        Gone you are</br>
        but your scentâ€”</br>
        it still lingers</br>
        all around me</br>
      </p>
