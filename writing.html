    <h2>Why I write</h2>
      <p>Art, words, images, the world around me, the sound of sweet voices and symphonies; in it lies
       my addiction to consume such wonders, but also to join the world as a creator. I guess that's
       why I started writing. I wanted to be consumed.

    <h2>Poetry</h2>
    <h3>late night panic</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>and in his indulgence of thought,</li>
        <li>his sanity was foregone;</li>
        <li>left alongside the sun as it slipped beyond the horizon.</li>
        <li>gently. for the madness seeps in like a slow poison.</li>
        <li>the anguish only when it's far too late.</li>
        <li>and he screams.</li>
        <li>and he screams.</li>
        <li>and he gasps hopelessly for useless oxygen,</li>
        <li>grasping desperately for sunlight only a few hours away.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>soft scent</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Sweet memories carried</li>
        <li>on the wind</li>
        <li>quiet but swift;</li>
        <li>swift but loud</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Gone you are</li>
        <li>but your scentâ€”</li>
        <li>it still lingers</li>
        <li>all around me</li>
      </ol>
