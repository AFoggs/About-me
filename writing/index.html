    <h2>Why I write</h2>
      <p>Art, words, images, the world around me, the sound of sweet voices and symphonies; in it lies
      my addiction to consume such wonders, but also to join the world as a creator. I guess that's
      why I started writing. I wanted to be consumed.

      <h3>late night panic</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>and in his indulgence of thought,</li>
          <li>his sanity was foregone;</li>
          <li>left alongside the sun as it slipped beyond the horizon.</li>
          <li>gently. for the madness seeps in like a slow poison.</li>
          <li>the anguish only when it's far too late.</li>
          <li>and he screams.</li>
          <li>and he screams.</li>
          <li>and he gasps hopelessly for useless oxygen,</li>
          <li>grasping desperately for sunlight only a few hours away.</li>

      <h3>Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as she walked in, she felt the tension in the air. Her parents always argued, but 
        there was something different about today. “Mom! Dad! I’m home!” She closed the front door and 
        went straight to her room. She let her bookbag drop onto the ground, took off her bra, and headed  
        towards the kitchen. “Hey mom. How was your day?” She asked as soon as she entered the kitchen. Her mother 
        stood at the sink, the water running. “It was fine. How was school, Katy?” Katy grabbed a red apple
        and took a bite into it before she began to talk about how her english teacher gave her class a pop
        quiz, but her friend who had the class a period before her warned her. “...So I think I did pretty good, 
        thanks to Amanda. Hey dad.” Katy said as her father walked into the room. “Hi.” he mumbled before opening
        the fridge. “Oh come on, she’s your daughter!” her mother suddenly shouted. Katy saw her lift her hands
        to her face before finally turning off the water. She turned around to face her husband, her eyes puffy,
        evidence that she had been crying.  “Goddammit, stop reading into every motherfucking thing that I 
        say or do!” he shouted, slamming the fridge shut. Katy could feel her body start to tense up, fearful 
        of the yelling. She didn’t leave though. Her parents always yelled at each other, and it was nothing 
        new. “Well shit, you just said you were going to leave us for crying out loud. What, did you think 
        I’d just let you leave and we weren’t going to talk about it? You thought you were just going to 
        leave Katy and I by ourselves in the middle of the night?” Katy’s mom folded her arms. “No, Dammit! 
        Stop trying to use her against me, Angela. You can’t make me stay here. I’m tired of you. I’m not 
        the bad guy here. I’m tired of you hurting me!”  Katy sat at the island, confused. She could feel 
        tears start to well up inside of her eyes. Suddenly, her mother started crying and eached behind her 
        back. “Nick...I love you. This is what I’ve always wanted. You, me, Katy. Us living in a nice house 
        together, happy. It would hurt me if you left us all alone to fend for ourselves. If you left Nick, 
        you’d take away all of our happiness.” Angela started to slowly approach Nick. “So instead of letting 
        you leave us, I’ll keep the memory of you alive you son of a bitch!”  Angela lunged at her husband, 
        slashing at him with the knife she produced from behind her back. Katy shrieked and fell out of her 
        chair and landed hard on the ground. She stayed there, cowering in fear. “Stop you psycho bitch!” Nick
        screamed as his wife slashed at him. “Mom, please! Stop this!” Katy shouted in desperation. Angela stopped.
        Then she kicked Nick in the groin, pushed him onto the ground, and began stabbing at his head and chest,
        screaming in between each and every single stab. “This! Is! For! Never! Loving! Me! Like! You! Said! 
        You! Would!” Heart pumping, Angela stabbed him one last time before leaving the knife buried inside of 
        his neck. Blood was everywhere. The floor beneath her was covered in a thin layer of blood, the wooden 
        cabinets stained red, blood staining the bottom of the fridge. Katy’s father lay dead, twelve stab wounds 
        covering his body. Three in the face, seven in the chest, and two in the neck. There were at least twice
        as many cuts lining his body. Bloodied, Angela got up and walked toward her daughter. Petrified with fear, 
        her daughter sat there on the ground and watched her mother approach her. She could see in her eyes 
        that her mother was broken. Something deep inside of her had snapped, and there was no turning back. 
        Angela opened her arms and embraced Katy. “It’s all going to be okay now. It’s all going to be okay.”  
        Katy sat there, unable to move. She listened to her mom say the same thing over and over again. “It’s 
        all going to be okay.” Angela repeated it over and over again. Even when she put her hands to her daughter's 
        throat. Even when Katy begged her to stop. Even as her daughter choked out that she hopes she rots in 
        hell, Angela still said it. Even though Katy’s lifeless body sat before her and her husband lay dead 
        only a few feet away from her, she kept saying it, “It’s all going to be okay.” When the police finally 
        arrived an hour and a half later, they found her there, still chanting the same phrase over and over again.
